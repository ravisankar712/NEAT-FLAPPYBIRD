# NEAT-FLAPPYBIRD
This is an implementation(maybe the 10^23rd one out here!) of the NEAT algorithm for the flappy bird game using PyGame. The NeuralNetwork used is a self made mini toy library. Find it here:https://github.com/ravisankar712/Neural-Network .
GAME CONTROLS: Use UP/DOWN arrow keys to speed up/slow down the evolution process. Use "b" to show only the best bird in the current generation. 
To change the mutation rate or any other bird parameters like the jump force, go to bird.py file. To change the gap between the pipes or pipe width, goto the pipe.py file.
